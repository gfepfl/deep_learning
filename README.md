# Deep learning Mini Project 1
Binary classification on Mnist pairs of handwritten digits

The module contains six different architectures that gradually contain more information about the task.
By running the test.py script without any arguments, the different models get evaluated 15 times on 25 epochs.

Better performance is reached if the epochs are increased to 100.
